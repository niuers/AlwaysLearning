# Vector Space
## Why we need vector space? [1]
Loosely speaking mathematicans invented vector space to mean any type of mathematical object that can be multiplied by numbers and added together.

## Definition of vector space?

### Field
* A not so rigor definition of Field
```
A field is a set F of numbers with the property that if a, b ∈ F, then a+b, a−b, ab and a/b are also in F (assuming, of course, that b <> 0 in the expression a/b).
```

### Definition of Vector Space[1][2]
```
A vector space consists of a set V (elements of V are called vectors), a field F (elements of F are called scalars), 
and two operations :
• An operation called vector addition that takes two vectors v, w ∈ V, and produces a third vector, written v+w ∈ V.
• An operation called scalar multiplication that takes a scalar c ∈ F and a vector v ∈ V, and produces a new vector, written cv ∈ V.
```
