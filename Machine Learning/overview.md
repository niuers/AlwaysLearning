# Overview
1. Regression and classification can both be viewed as a task in function approximation.

# Linear Model
1. The linear model makes huge assumptions about structure and yields stable but possibly inaccurate preditions.
1. The method of k-nearest neighbors make very mild structural assumptions: its predictions are often accurate but can be unstable.
