# What is Pythonic?
1. Generic operations on sequence
1. Strong typing without variable declaration
1. An important Python API convention: functions or methods that change an object in place should return None to
make it clear to the caller that the object itself was changed, and no new object was created. e.g. list.sort()
1. Built-in tuple and mapping types
1. Structure by indentation
